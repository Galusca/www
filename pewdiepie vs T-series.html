                <h1>Pewdiepie VS T-sieres</h1>
                <p>PewDiePie vs T-Series was an online competition between two YouTube channels, PewDiePie (run by Felix Kjellberg) and T-Series (an Indian record company run by Bhushan Kumar), for the title of the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[note 1] T-Series has held the title of most-viewed channel since early 2017, and PewDiePie had been the most-subscribed channel since 2013. T-Series has temporarily overtaken PewDiePie on numerous occasions in 2019, and on 27 March 2019,[2] they became the most subscribed channel for five consecutive days before PewDiePie retook the lead. After that, PewDiePie held the lead for 2 weeks, before T-Series came back as the most subscribed channel on YouTube. As of 7 May 2019, T-Series continues to hold the title as the most subscribed channel on YouTube, with a lead of over 2 million subscribers. On 28 April, PewDiePie released a video calling for his supporters to end their efforts to keep him as the most subscribed channel, and with the significant lead now held by T-Series, the entire subscriber battle is generally presumed to have ended.</p>

            <h1>Pewdiepie</h1>
            <p>Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, Kjellberg originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, he dropped out of Chalmers after losing interest in his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, Kjellberg began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and worked at a hot dog stand. Kjellberg soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.
